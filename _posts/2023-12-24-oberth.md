## Maths

The Oberth effect maximises the efficiency of a rocket burn by considering the instantaneous kinetic energy of the rocket at particular moments during its flight and selecting the most suitable time to burn. This concept can be understood by analysing the equation for the kinetic energy of a body at a given instantaneous moment.

$$
\delta KE = {1/2} m v^2
$$

## Example
On 25 December, 2021 at 1:20pm ACDT, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) launched from French Guiana aboard the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. However, at about T+08m:04s, the rocket and payload began losing altitude as shown in the altitude vs. distance travelled graph below<d-footnote>NASA (2021) James Webb Space Telescope Launch â€” Official NASA Broadcast Dec 25, 2021. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nT7JGZMbtM&t=6710s&ab_channel=NASA (Accessed: Jan 03, 2022).</d-footnote>. By losing altitude, the craft traded some gravitational potential energy for some extra kinetic energy - increasing its speed. Now at a higher initial velocity than it would have been without the energy trade, the rocket began burning its engines for a specific change in velocity. The total kinetic energy increase was more efficient due to the engine burn at higher initial speed (Oberth effect). Utilising the Oberth effect, the Ariane 5 achieved such a fuel efficient payload orbit injection that the JWST now has significantly more propellant than expected to sustain its exploration mission. This extra propellant is expected to extend the lifetime of the JWST far beyond its initially expected 10 years.
