<b>8/10</b>

'The Strange and Beautiful Story of Quantum Physics' expertly brings you into the microcosm of some of the smartest minds the world has ever seen, and guides you through why quantum mechanics is so notoriously nonintuitive. This approach is a refreshing change to most other literature around this topic which tries, and often fails, to explain quantum mechanics itself. Technical notes are quick and concise, never delving too deep such that you lose understanding, nor too brief that you can't fully appreciate the significance of these discoveries.
