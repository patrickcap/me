<b>9/10</b>

'Rocket Men' throws you into the midst of the space race between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, summer of 1968. The focus on the astronauts (Frank Borman, James Lovell Jr. and William Anders), their families, and the growing risks of their goal to put a man on the moon before 1970, sets the stage for the gripping story of how a will to win transformed into a will to survive for Apollo 8.
