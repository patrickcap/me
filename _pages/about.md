I am currently a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Airbus and a graduate Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (Honours) and Mathematical and Computer Sciences student from the University of Adelaide.

I have a keen interest for self-development and frequent learning of new skills (the main reason I decided to code this website from scratch). Fields of particular interest to me are artificial intelligence and aerospace. This drives my passion for aerospace engineering/design, programming and cybersecurity. In my spare time, I like to exercise outdoors, play sports, build rockets, and watch yacht racing.
